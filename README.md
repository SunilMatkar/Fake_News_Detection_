# Fake_News_Detection_
The role of social media in our day-to-day life has increased rapidlyin recent years. It is now
used not only for social interaction, but also as an important platform for exchanging
information and news. Twitter, Facebook a micro blogging service, connects millions of users
around the world and allows for the real-time propagation of infor- mation and news. Fake
news has become a major problem in these social networks. Fake news has become a major
problem in these social networks Fake news has vast impact in our modern society. Detecting
Fake news is an important step. This work purposes the use of machine learning techniques
to detect Fake news, using NLP algorithm. The normalization method is important step for
cleans- ing data before using the machine learning method to classify data.This model counts
the credibility of content and user reputation. This method developsa method for
automating fake news detection on social media by learning to predict accuracy assessments
in credibility-focused Twitter dataset.


# Problem Statement

To study Various Machine Learning algorithm which are applicable to detect and address the  fake news detection process and also implement a tool that stimulates efficient and faster decision making using computational algorithm.

# Objectives

    To study on how Machine Learning can classify the data collected into two categories.(Real / Fake)
 
    To develop a Natural Processing Language model based on collected data from dataset.  

    To evaluate the accuracy of developed model
